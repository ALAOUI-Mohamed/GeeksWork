Mini Game Production Project
Part 1: Game Concept & Pre-Production (30%)
High Concept Statement

Echo Step is a short 2D puzzle-platformer where the player creates temporary “echoes” of their past movements to solve traversal challenges. The core mechanic focuses on timing and spatial planning rather than reflex-heavy action. The game targets casual-to-midcore players who enjoy thoughtful puzzle games like Braid or The Swapper.

Mini Game Design Document (Mini GDD)

Genre
2D Puzzle Platformer

Core Mechanics

Player movement: run, jump

“Echo” ability: records the player’s movement for a few seconds and replays it as a ghost character

Echoes can activate switches, block hazards, or act as temporary platforms

Core Gameplay Loop

Player explores a small level

Encounters an obstacle that cannot be solved alone

Records an echo and replays it

Uses coordination between player and echo to progress

Reaches goal and moves to next level

Level / Environment Ideas

Minimalist rooms with platforms, pressure plates, spikes, and doors

Levels gradually introduce tighter timing and multiple echoes

Single-screen or small scrolling levels to keep scope limited

Key Assets

Visual: player sprite, echo sprite (transparent variant), platforms, hazards, switches

Audio: jump sound, echo activation sound, ambient background music

UI: restart button, echo timer indicator

Art Direction

Simple, abstract pixel art

Muted color palette with bright highlights for interactive objects

Echo character visually distinct through transparency or glow

Pipeline Plan (Text-Based Flowchart)

Pre-Production

Concept & GDD → Scope definition → Core mechanic planning
Roles:

Designer (mechanics, levels)

Producer (scope, schedule)

Production

Prototype core mechanic

Build 2–3 test levels

Implement basic visuals and audio
Roles:

Programmer (movement, echo system)

Artist (sprites, UI)

Audio (basic SFX)

Post-Production

Playtesting

Bug fixing

Reflection & documentation
Roles:

QA (testing, feedback)

Producer (final review)

Part 2: Rapid Prototyping & Iteration (25%)
Prototype

A digital prototype was created in Unity featuring:

Player movement

Echo recording and playback

One test level using a pressure plate and door

Playtest & Feedback

Playtester Feedback:
The echo mechanic was interesting, but it was unclear when the echo was recording and how long it lasted.

Iteration & Reflection

To address this, a visible timer bar was added during echo recording, and the echo sprite briefly flashes before playback starts. This change improved clarity and reduced player confusion without altering the core mechanic.

Part 3: Team Structure & Collaboration Simulation (20%)
Team Roles (Simulated Solo Team)

Designer: Defines mechanics, levels, and player experience

Programmer: Implements movement, echo system, and interactions

Artist: Creates sprites, UI, and visual feedback

Audio Designer: Adds sound effects and ambient audio

Producer: Manages scope, deadlines, and task priorities

QA Tester: Playtests and reports issues

Each role is necessary to simulate real production dependencies and highlight how tasks overlap in small teams.

Workflow Simulation

Tasks were organized on a simple task board with columns for To Do, In Progress, and Done. The producer role reviews progress weekly, while QA feedback informs design and programming changes. Communication flows from QA → Designer/Programmer → Producer for final decisions.

Part 4: Post-Mortem & Reflection (25%)
Self-Evaluation

The strongest part of production was pre-production, as defining a limited scope prevented feature creep. The biggest challenge was balancing mechanic clarity with simplicity. Production was the most critical phase because small implementation issues had a large impact on player understanding.

Team Evaluation (Simulated)

Each role contributed to maintaining structure and focus. In a real team, clearer communication between design and programming—especially earlier playtesting—would improve iteration speed and reduce rework.

Lessons Learned & Next Steps

Key Lesson:
Clear visual feedback is essential when introducing a new mechanic.

Improvement for Full Production:
Introduce a short tutorial level that teaches the echo mechanic step-by-step.

Next Feature to Expand:
Allow multiple echoes at once, increasing puzzle complexity and strategic depth.

Lessons Learned Summary

This project demonstrated how even small games benefit from structured pipelines, defined roles, and early playtesting. Iteration based on feedback was critical to improving player experience, reinforcing the importance of rapid prototyping in game production.
