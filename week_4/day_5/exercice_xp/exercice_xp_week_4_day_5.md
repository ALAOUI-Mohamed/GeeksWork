###### **Game Production Pipeline (Visual – Table Format)**

|Phase|Key Tasks|Outputs|
|-|-|-|
|Pre-Production|Game vision, core mechanic definition, mini GDD, prototype|GDD, paper prototype|
|Production|Asset creation, coding mechanics, level design, sound integration|Playable game build|
|Post-Production|Bug fixing, balancing, polish, final testing, release|Final build|

###### **Phase Descriptions**



###### **Pre-Production**

This phase focuses on defining the game’s vision and scope. A mini GDD outlines gameplay mechanics, target audience, and art style. Simple prototypes (paper or digital) are created to test the core mechanic—switching between light and shadow—to ensure it is fun and feasible before full development begins.



###### **Production**

During production, the team creates all required assets and systems. Programmers implement player movement, world-switching mechanics, and collision. Artists design characters, environments, and UI, while designers build levels around puzzle progression. Audio and basic UI elements are added toward the end of this phase.



###### **Post-Production**

This phase focuses on polish and stability. Bugs are fixed, controls are refined, and difficulty is balanced based on testing feedback. Final performance checks are completed, and the game is prepared for release.



##### **2. Team Roles Mapping**

###### **Roles \& Responsibilities**



* Game Designer – Designs core mechanics, levels, and gameplay balance. Maintains the GDD.
* Programmer – Implements gameplay systems, player controls, and game logic.
* 2D Artist – Creates characters, environments, UI elements, and animations.
* Sound Designer – Produces sound effects and background music.
* QA Tester – Tests the game, identifies bugs, and provides usability feedback.
* Producer (optional / student lead) – Manages scope, deadlines, and team communication.

Designers and programmers collaborate closely on mechanics, while QA provides feedback to all departments. The producer ensures communication stays organized.



##### **3. Rapid Prototyping Exercise**

###### **Chosen Mechanic**



World-switching between Light Mode and Shadow Mode, which changes available platforms.



###### **Prototype Description**



A paper prototype was created showing a level split into two versions. Platforms appear or disappear depending on the active mode. The player “switches” modes using a button to reach the exit.



###### **Peer Feedback**



“The switching mechanic is interesting, but it might be confusing without a visual indicator.”



###### **Reflection (4 sentences)**



The prototype successfully demonstrated how switching worlds affects platform availability. The core idea was easy to understand and engaging. However, it became clear that strong visual feedback is needed to avoid player confusion. Adding color changes or screen effects would improve clarity in future iterations.



##### **4. Game Design Document (Mini GDD)**

###### **Game Title \& Genre**



Shadow Hop – 2D Puzzle Platformer



###### **Core Gameplay Loop**



Explore level → Switch worlds → Solve platform puzzle → Reach exit → Advance to next level



###### **Target Audience**



Casual and indie game players aged 12+, fans of puzzle and platformer games.



###### **Key Mechanics**



Player movement (run, jump)



World-switching mechanic



Environmental puzzles



Increasing difficulty per level



###### **Art Style**



Minimalist 2D art with high contrast: bright light environments and dark shadow versions.



##### **5. Post-Mortem Reflection**

###### **Reflection Summary**



One aspect that went well was early prototyping, which helped identify design issues quickly. A major challenge could be scope creep, especially with adding too many puzzle variations. Improving the pipeline by locking mechanics earlier would increase efficiency. Strong team communication, especially between design and programming, would be critical to avoid rework and delays.
