Scenario Context (Brief Restatement)

Our team is developing a Unity playable prototype under a tight deadline. Challenges include unclear ownership of tasks, limited or avoided feedback, rising stress as deadlines approach, and a minor conflict impacting collaboration. The following exercises outline strategies to improve communication, feedback, stress management, and conflict resolution.

Exercise 1: Communication & Role Clarity
Objective

Improve communication efficiency and clearly define team responsibilities to reduce confusion and rework.

Team Roles & Responsibilities
Role	Responsibilities	Primary Communication
Designer	Defines core gameplay mechanics, level layout, and player experience	Daily chat, weekly meeting
Programmer (Unity)	Implements movement, mechanics, UI, and bug fixes	Daily chat, documentation
Artist (Placeholder)	Creates or selects temporary assets and materials	Chat, asset folder
Producer / Team Lead	Tracks tasks, deadlines, and resolves blockers	Meetings, task board
Communication Channels

Discord / Slack:
Daily communication, quick questions, progress updates

Trello / Notion / Google Docs:
Task tracking and documentation

Weekly Team Meeting (15–30 min):
Progress review, feedback, and planning

Shared Drive / Git Repository:
Version control and file organization

Communication Plan

Daily:

Each member posts:

What they worked on

What they plan to do next

Any blockers

Weekly:

Short meeting to:

Review prototype progress

Playtest the current build

Assign tasks for the next sprint

Deliverable Outcome:
Clear ownership, fewer duplicated efforts, and improved accountability.

Exercise 2: Feedback & Iteration
Objective

Create a structured, safe feedback process that improves the prototype without harming team morale.

Feedback Framework

Observation → Impact → Suggestion

Observation: What was noticed (objective)

Impact: How it affected gameplay or understanding

Suggestion: A constructive improvement idea

Example Constructive Feedback

Observation:
“The jump height feels inconsistent when moving between platforms.”

Impact:
“This made it harder to judge distances and caused frustration during playtesting.”

Suggestion:
“Consider increasing the jump force slightly or adjusting gravity values for consistency.”

Feedback Process

Feedback is given during scheduled playtest sessions.

All feedback is documented in a shared document.

The team discusses feedback together.

The programmer implements agreed-upon changes.

Changes are tested in the next build.

Preventing Negative or Personal Feedback

Focus on the feature, not the person

Use neutral language and examples

Encourage team members to ask clarifying questions

Treat feedback as part of iteration, not criticism

Deliverable Outcome:
More productive discussions and faster improvement cycles.

Exercise 3: Stress Management & Conflict Resolution
Objective

Reduce stress and resolve conflict to maintain healthy collaboration and productivity.

Sources of Stress & Solutions
1. Tight Deadlines

Solutions:

Break tasks into smaller, achievable goals

Prioritize core features over polish

2. Unclear Responsibilities

Solutions:

Assign clear task ownership

Use a task board to track progress

3. Fear of Giving Feedback

Solutions:

Normalize feedback as part of development

Use structured feedback sessions instead of spontaneous criticism

Conflict Scenario

Scenario:
A disagreement arises between the designer and programmer about whether to add a dash mechanic close to the deadline.

Conflict Type

Task Conflict (disagreement over feature scope)

Conflict Resolution Strategy

Identify the shared goal: delivering a stable prototype

Evaluate time and technical constraints

Decide whether the feature supports the core loop

Defer non-essential features to a future iteration

Leadership Behavior to Support the Team

Encourage respectful discussion

Keep decisions aligned with project goals

Acknowledge stress and effort

Step in early to prevent escalation
