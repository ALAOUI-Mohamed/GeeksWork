Engine Prototype — Playable Digital Version (Unity)
Core Gameplay

Working Mechanic(s):

Player movement using WASD

Jumping using Space

Collecting objects via trigger collisions

Basic Game Rules:

Start Condition:
The game begins when the Unity scene loads and the player gains control immediately.

Goal Condition:
Collect all collectible objects in the level to complete the game.

Fail / Restart Condition:
If the player falls off the platform, they are reset to the starting position.

Simple UI

Unity UI Text (Canvas):

“Collected: X / Y”

“You Win!” message upon completion

Debug text:

“WASD to Move”

“Space to Jump”

Temporary Assets

Unity primitives (Cube, Sphere, Plane)

Default materials and colors

No animations, sounds, or visual polish

Deliverables

Playable Build:
Windows (.exe) build exported from Unity

Short Video Demo (30–60 sec):
Shows:

Player movement and jumping

Collecting objects

Falling off and respawning

Winning the level

Design Change Log (3–5 Bullet Points)

Reduced the number of collectibles
→ Original count felt repetitive
→ Improved pacing and clarity of the goal

Adjusted jump force values
→ Players struggled to reach platforms
→ Jumping felt more responsive and fun

Added on-screen instructions
→ Testers didn’t immediately know the controls
→ Improved onboarding

Changed failure from game over to respawn
→ Falling felt too punishing
→ Encouraged experimentation

Part 4 — Playtesting & Iteration
Playtesting Setup

Conducted two digital playtests

Testers played the Unity build remotely

Feedback gathered through observation and follow-up questions

Insights Gathered from Testers (5–7)

The goal wasn’t immediately clear at the start.

Jumping was the most enjoyable part of the prototype.

Falling off platforms felt frustrating initially.

Platform spacing was sometimes hard to judge.

Seeing collectible progress was motivating.

The game felt short but easy to replay.

Winning needed clearer feedback.

Changes Applied & Why

Added a collectible counter UI
→ Made the goal and progress clearer

Added player respawn instead of restarting the scene
→ Reduced frustration

Adjusted platform distances
→ Improved readability and fairness

Added a “You Win” UI message
→ Gave clear completion feedback

Changes Not Applied (with Justification)

Did not add enemies or hazards
→ Would increase complexity
→ Outside the scope of a core-movement prototype

Part 5 — Final Presentation (5–7 Minutes)
1. Core Concept

Title:
“Jump Prototype” (rename if needed)

Core Loop:
Move → Jump → Collect → Avoid Falling → Complete Level

Player Fantasy:
“Feel like a nimble character navigating simple platform challenges.”

2. Pipeline Overview

➡️ Paper Prototype

Sketched level layout and jump distances

➡️ Blockout

Grayboxed level using Unity cubes and planes

➡️ Engine Prototype

Implemented movement, jumping, and collecting in Unity

➡️ Tester Feedback

Identified confusion around goals and frustration points

➡️ Final Iteration

Added UI, tuned jump physics, adjusted level layout

3. What You Learned

What Surprised You:

Small UI changes dramatically improved player understanding

What Was the Hardest Part:

Tuning jump physics to feel responsive

What Would You Do Next:

Add multiple levels

Introduce a dash or moving platforms
