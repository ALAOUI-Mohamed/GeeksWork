League of Legends:
Goal, Rules, and Core Loop

Goal: Destroy the enemy "Nexus" located at the heart of their base while defending your own.
Rules: Two teams of five players control unique champions, gaining power by defeating AI minions, monsters, and enemy players across three lanes.
Core Loop: Kill units to earn gold and XP -> Purchase items and level up abilities -> Win teamfights and destroy defensive turrets to push toward the Nexus.

Key Action Feedback
Action: Last-hitting a minion.
Feedback: A satisfying, metallic "clink" sound effect paired with bright gold text floating upward from the fallen unit.

SCAMPER:

Substitute: Replace Mana with Health for all champions—every spell cost now puts your life at risk.

Combine: Merge two champions together into a Duo-Body (one player moves, the other aims the spells).

Adapt: Add a Day/Night cycle from Dota; some champions get stronger or gain extra vision when the sun goes down.

Modify: Change the Fog of War to be "Liquid"—you move slower when walking through areas you haven't scouted.

Put to another use: Turn the map into a Racing Game where players use their dash abilities to finish laps while dodging turret fire.

Eliminate: Remove Wards and Vision entirely—the map is pitch black unless you are standing right there.

Reverse: Flip the Camera Angle to a third-person, over-the-shoulder view for a more "action-RPG" feel.
